# Exercise 3: Mask and observe

**Time:** 15 minutes

## The brief

Street addresses never reach the model, and every lookup records who asked.
Then make sure FastMCP Gateway stops storing what your tools return.

Each 311 request has the street address of the problem.
The DataSF terms forbid using this data to identify people, and a model does not need a house number to answer questions about a neighborhood.

## Rules

- `search_requests` and `get_request` return addresses only to the block: `994 HARRISON ST, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107, US` becomes `900 block of HARRISON ST`.
  An address with no house number, such as an intersection, stays as it is.
- `get_request` logs one line that includes the caller's email, read with `caller_email()` from `sf311.kit`.
  Locally there is no caller, so log `local`.

## Steps

1. Ask your coding agent:

   ```text
   Read exercises/03-mask-and-observe.md and make the changes. Run tests/test_ex3.py until it passes, and keep tests/test_ex2.py passing.
   ```

2. Commit and push, then wait for `Live`.

## Prove it

1. Ask your agent: `Show me three recent encampment reports, then get the details of the first one.`
   The addresses end at the block.
2. Open **Logs** and select the `get_request` row.
   The response payload shows the masked address.
   The actor is you.
3. Open the deployment's **Server logs** from the **Deployments** page.
   You see your log line with your email.
   That email came from the gateway, which verified your sign-in and set the header before your code ran.
4. In your server's **Settings**, open **General**, find **Data Controls**, and turn off **Log MCP Responses**.
   This setting applies to every tool on the server.
5. Ask for another request's details, then open the new `get_request` row in **Logs**.
   The row is there, but its response payload is not stored.

## Stretch goals

- Ask your agent for `get_request` on an ID from another neighborhood, and check that the log line still shows your email.
- Turn **Log MCP Responses** back on, and decide which of your tools would need it off in a real deployment.

## If you fall behind

```bash
cp solutions/ex3/server.py server.py
git commit -am "Use the Exercise 3 solution" && git push
